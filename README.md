# The Afferoish MIT License

A thought experiment.

The Afferoish MIT License is the MIT License with an extra requirement:
If you use the licensed software as part of a hosted service, you have
to reproduce the copyright notice and permission notice on a World Wide
Web page accessible to users.

The idea, and most of the new language, come from the GNU Affero Public
License Version 3 (AGPL-3.0). The AGPL extends the sharing requirement
of the GNU Public License Version 3 to modifications used in "network
server software".

If Free Software licensors want to receive source code for software they
provide, the ability to withhold source code just because software isn't
"distributed", but merely provided as a service online, is a loophole.

If Open-Source Software licensors want to receive credit for software
they provide, isn't the ability to withhold credit just because the
software isn't distributed, but merely provided as a service online,
also a loophole?
