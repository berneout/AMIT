# The Afferoish MIT License

A thought experiment.

The Afferoish MIT License is the MIT License, with an extra requirement:
In addition to requiring those who distribute copies of the software to
reproduce copyright and permission notices, those using the licensed
software as part of hosted services have to reproduce the copyright
notice and permission notice on a World Wide Web page accessible to
remote users.

The idea, and most of the new language, come from the GNU Affero Public
License Version 3 (AGPL-3.0). The AGPL extends the sharing requirement
of the GNU Public License Version 3 to modifications used in "network
server software".

If Free Software licensors want to receive source code for software they
provide, the ability to withhold source code just because software isn't
"distributed", but merely provided as a service online, is a loophole.

If Open-Source Software licensors want to receive credit for software
they provide, isn't the ability to withhold credit just because the
software isn't distributed, but merely provided as a service online,
also a loophole?
