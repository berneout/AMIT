# The Afferoish MIT License

A thought experiment.

The Afferoish MIT License is the MIT License with an extra requirement:
If you use the licensed software as part of a hosted service, you have
to reproduce the copyright notice and permission notice on a World Wide
Web page accessible to users.

If Free Software licensors want source code for software they provide,
the ability to withhold source code just because software isn't
"distributed", but merely provided as a service online, is a loophole.
The GNU Affero Public License Version 3 tries to close that loophole.

If Open-Source Software licensors want credit for software they provide,
isn't the ability to withhold credit just because the software isn't
distributed, but merely provided as a service online, also a loophole?
The Afferoish MIT License tries to close that loophole.
